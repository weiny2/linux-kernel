Compute eXpress Link

What IP features are eanbled by this code?
  CXL enumeration for Devices and Ports
  Basic PCIe UUID string identification for CXL hardware when running OSC
  Requires CXL hardware (PCIe card)
  Will dmesg provide output (dev_info) for success or failure
  Provides experimental ACPI _OSC support for CXL with supporting BIOS
  Provides Workaround for HW issue with wrong CXL Vendor ID in Cambria/TBF

This patch includes CXL_OSC support as a part of ACPI.

This patch series implements basic Designated Vendor-Specific Extended
Capabilities (DVSEC) decode for Compute eXpress Link devices, a new CPU
interconnect building upon PCIe. As a basis for the CXL support it provides
PCI init handling for detection, decode, and caching of CXL device
capabilities.  Moreover, it makes use of the DVSEC Vendor ID and DVSEC ID so
as to identify a CXL capable device. (PCIe r5.0, sec 7.9.6.2)

For your reference, pciutils upstream has support for lscpi CXL DVSEC decode.

This patch makes use of pending DVSEC related header additions and the
first patch of that series is included here. It can be sorted out when the
upstream merge is done.
