Enable ext4 support for per-file/directory DAX operations

Changes from V4:
	Fix up DAX mutual exclusion with other flags.
	Add clean up patch (remove jflags)

Changes from V3:
	Change EXT4_DAX_FL to bit24
	Cache device DAX support in the super block and use that is
		ext4_should_use_dax()

Changes from V2:
	Rework DAX exclusivity with verity and encryption based on feedback
	from Eric

Enable the same per file DAX support in ext4 as was done for xfs.  This series
builds and depends on the V11 series for xfs.[1]

This passes the same xfstests test as XFS.

The only issue is that this modifies the old mount option parsing code rather
than waiting for the new parsing code to be finalized.

This series starts with 3 fixes which include making Verity and Encrypt truly
mutually exclusive from DAX.  I think these first 3 patches should be picked up
for 5.8 regardless of what is decided regarding the mount parsing.
