Description:	Interface for setting the driver's reset timeout.
		When a device reset (FLR) is issued, the driver waits for
		user-space to stop using the device before allowing the FLR to
		proceed, with a timeout. The device is considered in use if
		there are any open domain device file descriptors or memory
		mapped producer ports. (For PF device resets, this includes all
		VF-owned domains and producer ports.)

		The amount of time the driver waits for userspace to stop using
		the device is controlled by the module parameter
		reset_timeout_s, which is in units of seconds and defaults to
		5. If reset_timeout_s seconds elapse and any user is still
		using the device, the driver zaps those processes' memory
		mappings and marks their device file descriptors as invalid.
		This is necessary because user processes that do not relinquish
		their device mappings can interfere with processes that use the
		device after the reset completes. To ensure that user processes
		have enough time to clean up, reset_timeout_s can be increased.

Description:	Interface for configuring DLB load-balanced sequence numbers.

		The DLB has a fixed number of sequence numbers used for ordered
		scheduling. They are divided among four sequence number groups.
		A group can be configured to contain one queue with 1,024
		sequence numbers, or two queues with 512 sequence numbers each,
		and so on, down to 32 queues with 32 sequence numbers each.

		When a load-balanced queue is configured with non-zero sequence
		numbers, the driver finds a group configured for the same
		number of sequence numbers and an available slot. If no such
		groups are found, the queue cannot be configured.

		Once the first ordered queue is configured, the sequence number
		configurations are locked. The driver returns an error on writes
		to locked sequence number configurations. When all ordered
		queues are unconfigured, the sequence number configurations can
		be changed again.

		This file is only accessible for physical function DLB devices.

Description:
		The vf<N>_resources subdirectory contains a set of read-write
		files used to assign/remove device resources to/from virtual
		function (VF) devices.

		Writing a resource's file causes the driver to reassign that
		many of the resource from the physical function (PF) to the VF.
		This operation will fail if the PF does not contain sufficient
		available resources.

		When an assignment is reduced, i.e. a smaller number is written
		to a file than its current value, the difference is returned
		to the physical function.

		Reading a file returns the VF's current allocation of the
		resource.

		This subdirectory is only present for physical function DLB
		devices, and its contents are only writable when VF N is not
		locked.

		num_atomic_inflights:  Number of atomic inflights assigned to
				       VF N.

		num_dir_credit_pools:  Number of directed credit pools assigned
				       to VF N.

		num_dir_credits:       Number of directed credits assigned to
				       VF N.

		num_dir_ports:	       Number of directed ports (and queues)

Date:		February 27, 2020

Contact:	gage.eads@intel.com
Description:	Interface for assigning auxiliary VFs to a primary VF.

		Each DLB VF is limited to 32 MSI interrupt vectors, 31 of which
		are available for CQ interrupts. If a VF user (e.g. a guest OS)
		needs more CQ interrupts, they have to use more than one VF.
		To support this, the driver has a notion of "primary" and
		"auxiliary" VFs:
		* Primary: the VF is used as a normal DLB device. The
		  primary VF has 0+ auxiliary VFs supporting it.
		* Auxiliary: the VF doesn't have any resources of its
		  own, and serves only to provide the primary
		  VF with MSI vectors for its CQ interrupts.

		This file is used to assign auxiliary VFs. When a VF is made
		auxiliary to another, any resources it had are relinquished to
		the PF.

		When a primary VF has one or more auxiliary VFs, the entire VF
		group must be assigned to the same virtual machine, or else the
		primary VF will not function correctly.

Description:	Interface for re-enabling the VF BAR

		If the PF driver detects an overload of VF mailbox interrupts,

		disable the VF's FUNC BAR, effectively preventing access to the
		device through the VF.

		If the BAR is disabled, it will be re-enabled when the device
		is reset or the driver is reloaded. This interface can be used
		to re-enable the BAR as well, and can be read to determine
		whether the BAR is enabled.
