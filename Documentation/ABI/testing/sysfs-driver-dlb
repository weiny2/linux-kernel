Description:	Interface for setting the driver's reset timeout.
		When a device reset (FLR) is issued, the driver waits for
		user-space to stop using the device before allowing the FLR to
		proceed, with a timeout. The device is considered in use if
		there are any open domain device file descriptors or memory
		mapped producer ports. (For PF device resets, this includes all
		VF-owned domains and producer ports.)

		The amount of time the driver waits for userspace to stop using
		the device is controlled by the module parameter
		reset_timeout_s, which is in units of seconds and defaults to
		5. If reset_timeout_s seconds elapse and any user is still
		using the device, the driver zaps those processes' memory
		mappings and marks their device file descriptors as invalid.
		This is necessary because user processes that do not relinquish
		their device mappings can interfere with processes that use the
		device after the reset completes. To ensure that user processes
		have enough time to clean up, reset_timeout_s can be increased.
