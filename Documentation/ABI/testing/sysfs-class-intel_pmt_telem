Description:
		The telemX directory contains files describing an instance of a
		PMT telemetry device that exposes hardware telemetry. Each
		telemX device has an associated /dev/telemX node. This node can
		be opened and mapped to access the telemetry space of the
		device. The register layout of the telemetry space is
		determined from an XML file of specific guid for the corresponding
		parent device.
