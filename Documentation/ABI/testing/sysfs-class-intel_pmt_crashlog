Date:		April 2020
KernelVersion:	5.8
Contact:	Alexander Duyck <alexander.h.duyck@linux.intel.com>
Description:
		The intel_intel_pmt_crashlog/ class directory contains information
		for devices that expose crashlog capabilities using the Intel
		Platform Monitoring Technology (PTM).

Date:		April 2020
KernelVersion:	5.8
Contact:	Alexander Duyck <alexander.h.duyck@linux.intel.com>
Description:
		The crashlogX directory contains files for configuring an
		instance of a PMT crashlog device that can perform crash data
		recoring. Each crashlogX device has an associated
		/dev/crashlogX device node. This node can be opened and mapped
		to access the resulting crashlog data. The register layout for
		the log can be determined from an XML file of specified guid
		for the parent device.

What:		/sys/class/intel_pmt_crashlog/crashlogX/guid
Date:		April 2020
KernelVersion:	5.8
Contact:	Alexander Duyck <alexander.h.duyck@linux.intel.com>
Description:
		(RO) The guid for this crashlog device. The guid identifies the
		version of the XML file for the parent device that should be
		used to determine the register layout.

What:		/sys/class/intel_pmt_crashlog/crashlogX/size
Date:		April 2020
KernelVersion:	5.8
Contact:	Alexander Duyck <alexander.h.duyck@linux.intel.com>
Description:
		(RO) The length of the result buffer in bytes that corresponds
		to the mapping size for the /dev/crashlogX device node.

What:		/sys/class/intel_pmt_crashlog/crashlogX/offset
Date:		April 2020
KernelVersion:	5.8
Contact:	Alexander Duyck <alexander.h.duyck@linux.intel.com>
Description:
		(RO) The offset of the buffer in bytes that corresponds
		to the mapping for the /dev/crashlogX device node.

What:		/sys/class/intel_pmt_crashlog/crashlogX/enable
Date:		April 2020
KernelVersion:	5.8
Contact:	Alexander Duyck <alexander.h.duyck@linux.intel.com>
Description:
		(RW) Boolean value controlling if the crashlog functionality
		is enabled for the /dev/crashlogX device node.

What:		/sys/class/intel_pmt_crashlog/crashlogX/trigger
Date:		April 2020
KernelVersion:	5.8
Contact:	Alexander Duyck <alexander.h.duyck@linux.intel.com>
Description:
		(RW) Boolean value controlling  the triggering of the
		/dev/crashlogX device node. When read it provides data on if
		the crashlog has been triggered. When written to it can be
		used to either clear the current trigger by writing false, or
		to trigger a new event if the trigger is not currently set.
