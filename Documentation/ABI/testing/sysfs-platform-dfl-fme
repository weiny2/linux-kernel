What:		/sys/bus/platform/devices/dfl-fme.0/ports_num
Date:		June 2018
KernelVersion:  4.19
Contact:	Wu Hao <hao.wu@intel.com>
Description:	Read-only. One DFL FPGA device may have more than 1
		port/Accelerator Function Unit (AFU). It returns the
		number of ports on the FPGA device when read it.

What:		/sys/bus/platform/devices/dfl-fme.0/bitstream_id
Date:		June 2018
KernelVersion:  4.19
Contact:	Wu Hao <hao.wu@intel.com>
Description:	Read-only. It returns Bitstream (static FPGA region)
		identifier number, which includes the detailed version
		and other information of this static FPGA region.

What:		/sys/bus/platform/devices/dfl-fme.0/bitstream_metadata
Date:		June 2018
KernelVersion:  4.19
Contact:	Wu Hao <hao.wu@intel.com>
Description:	Read-only. It returns Bitstream (static FPGA region) meta
		data, which includes the synthesis date, seed and other
		information of this static FPGA region.

Date:		August 2019
KernelVersion:  5.4
Contact:	Wu Hao <hao.wu@intel.com>
Description:	Read-only. It returns cache size of this FPGA device.

What:		/sys/bus/platform/devices/dfl-fme.0/fabric_version
Date:		August 2019
KernelVersion:  5.4
Contact:	Wu Hao <hao.wu@intel.com>
Description:	Read-only. It returns fabric version of this FPGA device.
		Userspace applications need this information to select
		best data channels per different fabric design.

What:		/sys/bus/platform/devices/dfl-fme.0/socket_id
Date:		August 2019
KernelVersion:  5.4
Contact:	Wu Hao <hao.wu@intel.com>
Description:	Read-only. It returns socket_id to indicate which socket
		this FPGA belongs to, only valid for integrated solution.
		User only needs this information, in case standard numa node
		can't provide correct information.
