Intel(R) SGX is a set of architectural extensions that enables applications to
establish secure containers, a.k.a. enclaves.  SGX enclaves provide security
guarantees such as integrity and confidentiality, even when running on a system
where privileged software, e.g. kernel, hypervisor, etc... is untrusted and
potentially malicious.
