Live Kernel Patching with kGraft

kGraft's developement was started by the SUSE Labs. kGraft builds on
technologies and ideas that are already present in the kernel: ftrace [1] and
its mcount-based reserved space in function headers [2], the INT3/IPI-NMI
patching also used in jump labels [3], and RCU-like update of code that does
not require stopping the kernel.

A kGraft patch is a kernel module and fully relies on the in-kernel module
loader to link the new code with the kernel. Thanks to all that, the design
can be nicely minimalistic.

While kGraft is, by choice, limited to replacing whole functions and constants
they reference, this does not limit the set of code patches that can be
applied significantly. kGraft offers tools to assist in creating the live
patch modules, identifying which functions need to be replaced based on a
patch, and creating the patch module source code. They are located in
tools/kgraft/.
