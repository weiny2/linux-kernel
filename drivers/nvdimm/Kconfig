	  Generic support for non-volatile memory devices including
	  ACPI-6-NFIT defined resources.  On platforms that define an
	  NFIT, or otherwise can discover NVDIMM resources, a libnvdimm
	  bus is registered to advertise PMEM (persistent memory)
	  namespaces (/dev/pmemX) and BLK (sliding mmio window(s))
	  namespaces (/dev/ndX). A PMEM namespace refers to a memory
	  resource that may span multiple DIMMs and support DAX (see
	  CONFIG_DAX).  A BLK namespace refers to an NVDIMM control
	  region which exposes an mmio register set for windowed
	  access mode to non-volatile memory.
