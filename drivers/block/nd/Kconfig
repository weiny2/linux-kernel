	  Support for non-volatile memory devices defined by the NVDIMM
	  Firmware Interface Table. (NFIT)  On platforms that define an
	  NFIT, via ACPI, or other means, a "nd_bus" is registered to
	  advertise PM (persistent memory) namespaces (/dev/pmemX) and
	  BLOCK (sliding block data window) namespaces (/dev/ndX). A PM
	  namespace refers to a system-physical-address-range than may
	  span multiple DIMMs and support DAX (see CONFIG_DAX).  A BLOCK
	  namespace refers to a NVDIMM control region which exposes a
	  register-based windowed access mode to non-volatile memory.
	  See the NVDIMM Firmware Interface Table specification for more
	  details.

config ND_CORE

	help
	  Platform agnostic device model for an NFIT-defined bus.
	  Publishes resources for a NFIT-persistent-memory driver and/or
	  NFIT-block-data-window driver to attach.  Exposes a device
	  topology under a "ndX" bus device and a "/dev/ndctl<N>"
	  dimm-ioctl message passing interface per registered NFIT
	  instance.  A userspace library "ndctl" provides an API to
	  enumerate/manage this subsystem.

config ND_MANUAL_DSM

	depends on NFIT_ACPI
	default NFIT_ACPI
	help
	  Manually run vendor specific _DSM commands by directly interacting
	  with the Falcon Valley mailbox registers, as opposed to using the
	  ACPI _DSM method via the BIOS.  This is meant to be a stopgap while
	  _DSM support is being implemented in the BIOS, and should eventually
	  be removed from our driver.

config NFIT_ACPI
	tristate "NFIT ACPI: Discover ACPI-Namespace NFIT Devices"
	select ND_CORE
	depends on ACPI
	help
	  Infrastructure to probe the ACPI namespace for NVDIMMs and
	  register the platform-global NFIT blob with the core.  Also
	  enables the core to craft ACPI._DSM messages for platform/dimm
	  configuration.

config NFIT_ACPI_DEBUG
	bool "NFIT ACPI: Turn on extra debugging"
	depends on NFIT_ACPI
	depends on DYNAMIC_DEBUG
	default n
	help
	  Enabling this option causes the nd_acpi driver to dump the
	  input and output buffers of _DSM operations on the ACPI0012
	  device, which can be very verbose.  Leave it disabled unless
	  you are debugging a hardware / firmware issue.

config NFIT_LOCAL

	select ND_CORE
	select NFIT_LOCAL_DEV
	help
	  Enable this option and create an NFIT with the 'ndctl
	  create-nfit' utility.   Use this facility for cases where platform
	  firmware does not describe persistent memory ranges, or
	  otherwise need to custom-define persistent memory ranges.

	  Say 'm' here and a module named "local_nfit" will be created
	  that will load a firmware file named "local_nfit.bin" in to the nd
	  subsystem.

	  Say 'y' here to build "local_nfit" into the kernel
	  and consider also using the CONFIG_EXTRA_FIRMWARE facility to
	  provide "local_nfit.bin" in the kernel image directly.

config NFIT_TEST

	depends on m
	help
	  For development purposes register a manufactured
	  NFIT table to verify the resulting device model topology.
	  Note, this module arranges for ioremap_cache() to be
	  overridden locally to allow simulation of system-memory as an
	  io-memory-resource.

	  Note, this test expects to be able to find at least
	  256MB of CMA space (CONFIG_CMA_SIZE_MBYTES) or it will fail to
	  load.  Kconfig does not allow for numerical value
	  dependencies, so we can only warn at runtime.

	  Enabling this option will degrade the performance of other BLK
	  namespaces.  Do not enable for production environments.

	  Say N unless you are doing development of the 'nd' subsystem.

config BLK_DEV_PMEM
	tristate "PMEM: Persistent memory block device support"
	depends on ND_CORE
	default ND_CORE
	help
	  Memory for PMEM is described by an NFIT (NVDIMM Firmware
	  Interface Table).  This table is either furnished by the
	  platform (see CONFIG_NFIT_ACPI), or it is custom defined by
	  the ndctl utility (see CONFIG_NFIT_LOCAL).  This driver
	  converts these persistent memory ranges into block devices
	  that are capable of support DAX (direct-access) file system
	  extensions.  See Documentation/blockdev/nd.txt for more
	  details.

	  Say Y if you want to use a NVDIMM described by NFIT

config ND_BLK

	depends on ND_CORE
	default ND_CORE
	help
	  This driver performs I/O using a set of DCR/BDW defined
	  apertures.  The set of apertures will all access the one
	  DIMM.  Multiple windows allow multiple concurrent accesses,
	  much like tagged-command-queuing, and would likely be used
	  by different threads or different CPUs.

	  The NFIT specification defines a standard format for a Block
	  Data Window.

	  A 'region' corresponds to an individual DIMM or an interleave
