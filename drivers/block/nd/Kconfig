menuconfig NFIT_DEVICES
	bool "NVDIMM (NFIT) Support"
	help
	  Support for non-volatile memory devices defined by the NVDIMM
	  Firmware Interface Table. (NFIT)  On platforms that define an
	  NFIT, via ACPI, or other means, a "nd_bus" is registered to
	  advertise PM (persistent memory) namespaces (/dev/pmemX) and
	  BLOCK (sliding block data window) namespaces (/dev/ndX). A PM
	  namespace refers to a system-physical-address-range than may
	  span multiple DIMMs and support DAX (see CONFIG_DAX).  A BLOCK
	  namespace refers to a NVDIMM control region which exposes a
	  register-based windowed access mode to non-volatile memory.
	  See the NVDIMM Firmware Interface Table specification for more
	  details.

	  Platform agnostic device model for an NFIT-defined bus.
	  Publishes resources for a NFIT-persistent-memory driver and/or
	  NFIT-block-data-window driver to attach.  Exposes a device
	  topology under a "ndX" bus device and a "/dev/ndctl<N>"
	  dimm-ioctl message passing interface per registered NFIT
	  instance.  A userspace library "ndctl" provides an API to
	  enumerate/manage this subsystem.

	select ND_CORE
	depends on ACPI
	help
	  Infrastructure to probe the ACPI namespace for NVDIMMs and
	  register the platform-global NFIT blob with the core.  Also
	  enables the core to craft ACPI._DSM messages for platform/dimm
	  configuration.
