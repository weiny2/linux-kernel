menuconfig ND_DEVICES
	bool "NVDIMM (Non-Volatile Memory Device) Support"
	help
	  Generic support for non-volatile memory devices including
	  ACPI-6-NFIT defined resources.  On platforms that define an
	  NFIT, or otherwise can discover NVDIMM resources, a libnd
	  bus is registered to advertise PMEM (persistent memory)
	  namespaces (/dev/pmemX) and BLK (sliding mmio window(s))
	  namespaces (/dev/ndX). A PMEM namespace refers to a memory
	  resource that may span multiple DIMMs and support DAX (see
	  CONFIG_DAX).  A BLK namespace refers to an NVDIMM control
	  region which exposes an mmio register set for windowed
	  access mode to non-volatile memory.

	  For development purposes register a manufactured
	  NFIT table to verify the resulting device model topology.
	  Note, this module arranges for ioremap_cache() to be
	  overridden locally to allow simulation of system-memory as an
	  io-memory-resource.

	  Note, this test expects to be able to find at least 256MB of
	  contiguous DMA space (CONFIG_CMA_SIZE_MBYTES, cma=) or it
	  will fail to load.  This much contiguos memory is needed to
	  properly simulate a DAX capable memory region.

	  Say N unless you are doing development of the 'libnd' subsystem.

config BLK_DEV_PMEM
	tristate "PMEM: Persistent memory block device support"
	depends on LIBND
	default LIBND
	help
	  Memory ranges for PMEM are described by either an NFIT
	  (NVDIMM Firmware Interface Table, see CONFIG_NFIT_ACPI), a
	  non-standard OEM-specific E820 memory type (type-12, see
	  CONFIG_X86_PMEM_LEGACY), or it is manually specified by the
	  'memmap=nn[KMG]!ss[KMG]' kernel command line (see
	  Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt).  This driver converts
	  these persistent memory ranges into block devices that are
	  capable of DAX (direct-access) file system mappings.  See
	  Documentation/blockdev/nd.txt for more details.

	  Say Y if you want to use a NVDIMM described by ACPI, E820, etc...

config ND_BLK
	tristate "BLK: Block data window (aperture) device support"
	depends on LIBND
	default LIBND
	help
	  Support NVDIMMs, or other devices, that implement a BLK-mode
	  access capability.  BLK-mode access uses memory-mapped-i/o
	  apertures to access persistent media.

	  Say Y if your platform firmware emits an ACPI.NFIT table
	  (CONFIG_ACPI_NFIT), or otherwise exposes BLK-mode
	  capabilities.

config ND_BTT_DEVS
	bool

config ND_BTT
	tristate "BTT: Block Translation Table (atomic sector updates)"
	depends on LIBND
	default LIBND
	select ND_BTT_DEVS
	help
	  The Block Translation Table (BTT) provides atomic sector
	  update semantics for persistent memory devices, so that
	  applications that rely on sector writes not being torn (a
	  guarantee that typical disks provide) can continue to do so.
	  The BTT manifests itself as a stacked block device, and
	  reserves a portion of the underlying storage for its
	  metadata.

	  Select Y if unsure.

config ND_MAX_REGIONS
	int "Maximum number of regions supported by the sub-system"
	default 64
	---help---
	  A 'region' corresponds to an individual DIMM or an interleave
	  set of DIMMs.  A typical maximally configured system may have
	  up to 32 DIMMs.

	  Leave the default of 64 if you are unsure.

config ND_IOSTAT
	bool "LIBND: Enable iostat by default"
	default n
	---help---
	  Persistent memory i/o has very low latency to the point
	  where the overhead to measure statistics can dramatically
	  impact the relative performance of the driver.  Say y here
	  to trade off performance for statistics gathering that is
	  enabled by default.  These statistics can always be
	  enabled/disabled at run time via the 'iostat' attribute of
	  the block device's queue in sysfs.

	  If unsure, say N
