Test split lock and vmdos

By default, split lock/vmdos option is "warn". Use this kernel option
to change behavior of split lock/vmdos:

    split_lock_detect=
              #AC for split lock            #DB for bus lock

    off       Do nothing                    Do nothing

    warn      Kernel OOPs                   Kernel warn rate limited
              User warn rate limited        User warn rate limited

    fatal     Kernel OOPs                   Kernel warn rate limited
              Send SIGBUS to user           Send SIGBUS to user

    ratelimit N/A                           Kernel warn rate limited
                                            User application sleeps for 1 sec

To test split lock/vmdos in the kernel:
#insmod test_split_lock_drv.ko

To test split lock/vmdos in user:
#gcc split_lock_test_user.c -o split_lock_test_user
#split_lock_test_user

Please check the above behavior table to verify if the two tests work.
