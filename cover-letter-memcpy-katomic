kmap: Create memcpy/memzero/memcpy_page interface

The following pattern is used often:

	kmap()
	mempcy() OR memset()
	kunmap()

This is best done with k[un]map_atomic() instead of k[un]map().  Furthermore,
iov_iter.c already defined 3 functions which do exactly this.

	memcpy_from_page()
	memcpy_to_page()
	memzero_page()


Lift these to the core and replace the pattern as appropriate.

In addition the following pattern was found a number of places which has
similar requirements regarding kmap_atomic().

	kmap(p1)
	kmap(p2)
	copy_page()
	kunmap(p2)
	kunmap(p1)

Define a memcpy_page() as part of this new interface which can replace this
pattern and use it.

Once the kmap_local() implementation from Thomas is finalized we can replace
the kmap_atomics with kmap_local() in these common functions as a further
optimization.
