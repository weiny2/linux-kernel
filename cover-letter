PKS: Add Protection Keys Supervisor (PKS) support

This RFC series has been reviewed by Dave Hansen.

Changes from RFC V2:
	Clean up commit messages to reflect that writes and reads are prevented
	Clean up function names

Changes from RFC:
	Clean up commit messages based on Peter Zijlstra's and Dave Hansen's
		feedback
	Fix static branch anti-pattern
	New patch:
	(memremap: Convert devmap static branch to {inc,dec})
		This was the code I used as a model for my static branch which
		I believe is wrong now.
	New Patch:
	(x86/entry: Preserve PKRS MSR through exceptions)
		This attempts to preserve the per-logical-processor MSR, and
		reference counting during exceptions.  I'd really like feed
		back on this because I _think_ it should work but I'm afraid
		I'm missing something as my testing has shown a lot of spotty
		crashes which don't make sense to me.

This patch set introduces a new page protection mechanism for supervisor pages,
Protection Key Supervisor (PKS) and an initial user of them, persistent memory,
PMEM.

PKS enables protections on 'domains' of supervisor pages to limit supervisor
mode access to those pages beyond the normal paging protections.  They work in
a similar fashion to user space pkeys.  Like User page pkeys (PKU), supervisor
pkeys are checked in addition to normal paging protections and Access or Writes
can be disabled via a MSR update without TLB flushes when permissions change.
A page mapping is assigned to a domain by setting a pkey in the page table
entry.

Unlike User pkeys no new instructions are added; rather WRMSR/RDMSR are used to
update the PKRS register.

XSAVE is not supported for the PKRS MSR.  To reduce software complexity the
implementation saves/restores the MSR across context switches but not during
irqs.  This is a compromise which results is a hardening of unwanted access
without absolute restriction.

For consistent behavior with current paging protections, pkey 0 is reserved and
configured to allow full access via the pkey mechanism, thus preserving the
default paging protections on mappings with the default pkey value of 0.

Other keys, (1-15) are allocated by an allocator which prepares us for key
contention from day one.  Kernel users should be prepared for the allocator to
fail either because of key exhaustion or due to PKS not being supported on the
arch and/or CPU instance.

Protecting against stray writes is particularly important for PMEM because,
unlike writes to anonymous memory, writes to PMEM persists across a reboot.
Thus data corruption could result in permanent loss of data.

The following attributes of PKS makes it perfect as a mechanism to protect PMEM
from stray access within the kernel:

   1) Fast switching of permissions
   2) Prevents access without page table manipulations
   3) Works on a per thread basis
   4) No TLB flushes required

The second half of this series thus uses the PKS mechanism to protect PMEM from
stray access.

PKS is available with 4 and 5 level paging.  Like PKRU is takes 4 bits from the
PTE to store the pkey within the entry.


Implementation details
----------------------

Modifications of task struct in patches:
	(x86/pks: Preserve the PKRS MSR on context switch)
	(memremap: Add zone device access protection)

Because pkey access is per-thread 2 modifications are made to the task struct.
The first is a saved copy of the MSR during context switches.  The second
reference counts access to the device domain to correctly handle kmap nesting
properly.


Maintain PKS setting in a re-entrant manner in patch:
	(memremap: Add zone device access protection)
	(x86/entry: Preserve PKRS MSR through exceptions)

Using local_irq_save() seems to be the safest and fastest way to maintain kmap
as re-entrant.  But there may be a better way.  spin_lock_irq() and atomic
counters were considered.  But atomic counters do not properly protect the pkey
update and spin_lock_irq() would deadlock.  Suggestions are welcome.

Also preserving the pks state requires the exception handling code to store the
ref count during exception processing.  This seems like a layering violation
but it works.


The use of kmap in patch:
	(kmap: Add stray access protection for device pages)

To keep general access to PMEM pages general, we piggy back on the kmap()
interface as there are many places in the kernel who do not have, nor should be
required to have, a priori knowledge that a page is PMEM.  The modifications to
the kmap code is careful to quickly determine which pages don't require special
handling to reduce overhead for non PMEM pages.
